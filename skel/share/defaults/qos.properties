#  ---- Named queues to consume from
#
#       A service can consume messages from named queues. Other services can
#       write messages to such queues. A named queue has an unqualified cell
#       address, that is, an address without a domain name.
#
#       This property contains a comma separated list of named queues to
#       consume from.

# ---- Configuration for namespace database connection pool ---------------------------
#
#      The database connection pool reuses connections between successive
#      database operations.  By reusing connections dCache doesn't suffer
#      the overhead of establishing new database connections for each
#      operation.
#
#      The options here determine how qos behaves as the number of concurrent
#      requests fluctuates.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---- The maximum number of concurrent database connections
#
#      The recommended minimum setting is the number of scan threads
#      plus a few more for admin calls.
#
#      Since the scanner service shares the chimera database with pnfsmanager,
#      be sure to adjust the postgresql.conf max connections upwards
#      to accommodate both.  Pnfsmanager runs well with about 100
#      connections.  Adding a separate qos service means the
#      connections should be increased by at least the amount below.
#
qos.db.namespace.connections.max=10

# ---- The minimum number of idle database connections.
#
qos.db.namespace.connections.idle=1

#      may, however, adversely affect performance.

# ---- Configuration for verifier database connection pool ---------------------------
#
#      The database connection pool reuses connections between successive

qos.plugins.storage-info-extractor=${dcache.plugins.storage-info-extractor}

# ---- Thread queues --------------------------------------------------------------
#
#      There are different thread queues associated with each of the qos services.
#
#      In general, each (remote) service has an executor for handling the
#      processing of incoming messages.  The thread pools for these
#      are labeled 'submit-threads.'  In the case of the verifier,
#      there is also a bulk submission pool for handling bulk scan requests.
#
#      The verifier, scanner and adjuster in addition also have task thread pools.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---- Thread queue used during the request for and update to requirements.
#      In the current implementation, each thread makes a call to the namespace.
#
qos.limits.requirements.submit-threads=32

# ---- Thread queue used during the registration of a new operation.
#      Updates will do a verification of the pool locations; cancellation
#      also runs on these threads, but involves simply setting up a filter
#      (the actual cancellation is run on a different thread).
#
qos.limits.verifier.submit-threads=32

# ---- Thread queue used during the registration of a new operation.
#      Like the above, but loops over a list of files.
#
qos.limits.verifier.bulk-threads=8

# ---- Thread queue used when an operation becomes active (to verify
#      the requirements and send a message to the adjuster). Each thread makes
#      a call to the requirements service, then to the pools, and finally,
#      if necessary, to the adjuster service.
#
qos.limits.verifier.task-threads=32

# ---- Thread queue used to handle retirement of the operation.
#      Processes communication and removal from the store.
#
qos.limits.verifier.remove-threads=16

# ---- Thread queue used during the registration of a new adjustment task.
#      Minimal work is done on this thread.
#
qos.limits.adjuster.submit-threads=16

# ---- Thread queue used for tasks.  Note that the longer-running tasks
#      like staging relinquish the thread by waiting.
#
qos.limits.adjuster.task-threads=200

# ---- Thread queue used to handle responses from the verifier.  These
#      involve batched counts, and the amount of update work done on the
#      thread is small.  Should mirror the bulk threads on the verifier.
#
qos.limits.scanner.submit-threads=8

# ---- Thread queue used for scanning the namespace on pool state changes or
#      as part of a periodic check.  Requires a database connection,
#      which it holds onto for the life of the task being executed.
#
#      A note on pool operation throttling:
#
#      A pool scan or processing of a pool status message can generate
#      thousands, even millions, of file tasks.  Allowing too many pool
#      operations to run simultaneously can, aside from the increased
#      pressure on the namespace database, potentially overload the system.
#      Lowering the number of available threads may be necessary
#      if the number of files per pool is on the order of 2 million or
#      greater (or, alternately, one may need to increase the memory of the
#      JVM for the scanner service).

#
#      The following property controls the number of

#      This is on a per-source/target basis, if the error is judged retriable.
#      If there is a non-retriable error, but a different source or target
#      can be selected, the retry count is set back to 0 again.

# ---- Operation and task map checking.
#
#      The maximum interval which can pass before a check of waiting/completed

#      be shorter, as checks are also done each time a running task terminates).

# ---- Startup
#
#      When an entire dcache installation is brought on line at the same time,
#      pool status may not yet be available from the pool manager.  This
#      property sets an initial delay before pool info initialization
#      begins.  Setting this property to 0 skips the delay.

(one-of?MILLISECONDS|SECONDS|MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS)qos.limits.startup-delay.unit=SECONDS

# ---- Reloading.
#      It is possible that the verifier come on line faster than pools being registered, if
#      this is a full system restart.  Not to incur numerous errors, in case there are incomplete
#      operations in the store, we establish a grace period before reload.
#

(one-of?MILLISECONDS|SECONDS|MINUTES|HOURS|DAYS)qos.limits.verifier.reload-grace-period.unit=MINUTES

# ---- Periodic system scanning
#
#      The following properties control the periodic scanning to check
#      for qos consistency and initiate any adjustments that may be necessary
#      in the case of inconsistent state.   These scans touch all the inodes in the namespace
#      once and only once, in ascending order and according to the specific query.
#
#      The scan period refers to the default amount of time between sweeps to check for timeouts.
#      It is applied to the main thread of both the Pool Operation map and the System Operation map.
#
#      The scan windows refers to the amount of time between scheduled periodic
#      system diagnostic scans. NEARLINE means files which are CUSTODIAL NEARLINE and currently
#      have a cached copy; ONLINE refers to scans of all files with persistent copies, whether
#      or not they are REPLICA or CUSTODIAL. NEARLINE is disabled by default because it
#      can be very time consuming on large namespaces, but it may also be activated
#      using the admin command for occasional diagnostic checks during relatively idle periods.
#
#      The batch size for NEARLINE is lowered to serve as an implicit backgrounding or
#      de-prioritization (since the scan is done in batches, this allows for pre-emption by
#      ONLINE scans if they are running concurrently.
