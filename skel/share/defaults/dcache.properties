#  ---- Java VM options
#
#  Properties that control the options to the Java VM instances.
#
#  There are two kinds of Java virtual machine instances: short-lived
#  and long-lived.
#
#  The short-lived invocations are expected to run as quickly as
#  possible and generally complete within a few seconds.
#
#  The long-lived invocations are the dCache domains.  These will have
#  the same duration as a dCache domain; i.e., many months or years.
#
#  dCache uses different Java options to hint to the JVM that the
#  different invocations have different expected lifetimes; for
#  example, short-lived invocations should favour startup speed over
#  long-term optimisation.
#
#  The JVM options used are dcache.java.options and
#  dcache.java.options.short-lived, both of which include
#  dcache.java.options.common.  In general, these three properties
#  should not be directly reconfigured, but site customisation should
#  be achieved through other properties.  In particular, additional
#  java command-line arguments may be added by configuring either the
#  dcache.java.options.extra or dcache.java.options.short-lived.extra
#  property (or both).

#  This property allows site-specific extra options that are used only
#  for long-lived JVM instances.

#   Various components can bind to a particular network interface.  The value of
#   the dcache.net.listen property describes which interface a door should use.
#   The value is the IP address of the interface the component should use; for
#   example, the loop-back interface (commonly 'lo') is '127.0.0.1' for IPv4,
#   '::1' for IPv6.
#
#   The address '0.0.0.0' listens on all interfaces for IPv4
#   connections and '::' listens on all interfaces for IPv6
#   connections (depending on the platform, an IPv4 address may be
#   converted to the equivalent IPv6 address and match '::').  The
#   keyword 'any' will listen on all interfaces.
#
#   If a hostname is specified, the name is resolved to an address and the service
#   binds to that interface. When publishing this interface to SRM or the info
#   service, this name is used as is. Therefore it is advised to use an FQDN. If
#   an address is specified, reverse lookup to obtain the FQDN is performed.
#
#   In addition to the "normal" FQDN (a DNS A/AAAA record), some hosts
#   have a single alias FQDN (e.g., a CNAME record) that points to the
#   normal FQDN.  If clients are expected to use the alias FQDN then

#          Cell Communication

#  ---- Which message broker implementation to use
#
#   Selects between various message brokers. The message broker
#   determines how dCache domains communicate with each other. Valid
#   values are:
#
#   'cells' is the classic cells based system. It relies on a central
#   location service that all domains connect to. The host, port and
#   domain of this service is defined by dcache.broker.host,
#   dcache.broker.port and dcache.broker.domain.
#
#   'none' no broker connection is establish. This is used for single
#   domain deployments.
#
(not-for-services,one-of?cells|none)\
dcache.broker.scheme = cells


#  ---- Broker for interdomain communication
#
#   By default both the cells and the hybrid broker styles use a star
#   topology with all messages going through a central domain. This
#   domain is usually dCacheDomain, but any domain can be used.
#
#   As all other domains need to connect to the broker, broker.host
#   has to be configured throughout the dCache instance unless the
#   broker runs on the local host or if there is no broker.
#
#   Domains open a UDP port to listen for topology information.  The
#   information is sent from the ${dcache.broker.domain} domain.  The
#   port number that a domain listens for topology information is
#   configured by the dcache.broker.client.port property.  This is
#   either the port number or '0' (indicating a randomly chosen port
#   number).
#
#   NOTE: ${dcache.broker.client.port} must be EITHER a unique port
#   number OR '0'.  This means that it is almost certainly wrong to
#   configure this property anywhere other than in a domain's context
#   (i.e., immediately after declaring a domain).
#
#   Inter-domain messages are sent via TCP on port
#   ${dcache.broker.messaging.port}.  Since topology discovery uses
#   UDP, dcache.broker.port and dcache.broker.messaging.port may have
#   the same port number.

#  ---- Location of location manager configuration file
#
#   Only used when dcache.broker.scheme is cells and only by the
#   ${dcache.broker.domain} domain.  If the file doesn't exist then a
#   default 'star' topology is used, where the ${dcache.broker.domain}
#   domain accepts connections from all other domains and routes
#   messages accordingly.
#
#   If the ${dcache.broker.cells.config} file exists then it is read
#   by the lmd cell running in ${dcache.broker.domain} on startup.
#   This allows site-specific adjustments to the messaging topology.
#
#   Please note that adjusting the messaging topology is an advance
#   feature that few (if any) dCache deployments need to adjust.
#   Using a different messaging technology may be a preferable
#   solution; see dcache.broker.scheme property for the alternatives.

#
#  This setting controls for how long a key pair is reused. A compromised key could be used

# ---- On-line Certificate Status Protocol usage mode
#
# On-line Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an alternative to CRLs in which
# dCache consults an external service to check the validity of a particular certificate.
#
# This setting controls how dCache makes use of this protocol. The following documentation is copied
# from the EMI CANL library used by dCache.
#
#	REQUIRE
#
#	   Require, for each checked certificate, that at least one valid OCSP responder is defined and
#	   that at least one responder of those defined returns a correct certificate status.
#	   If all OCSP responders return error or unknown status, the last one received is treated as a
#	   critical validation error.
#	   Not suggested, unless it is guaranteed that well configured responder(s) is(are) defined
#	   and can handle all queries without timeouts.
#
#	IF_AVAILABLE
#
#	   Use OCSP for each certificate if a responder is available. OCSP 'unknown' status and
#	   query errors (as timeout) do not cause the validation to fail.
#	   Also a lack of defined responder doesn't cause the validation to fail.
#
#	IGNORE
#
#	   Do not use OCSP.

# ---- Flags to disable ciphers
#
#   Comma separated list of flags related to ciphers.  The following
#   flags are understood:
#
#   DISABLE_EC
#
#   Support for certain Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) ciphers
#   is broken with some versions of OpenJDK 7 on Linux; the problem
#   may also affect some versions of OpenJDK 8.
#
#   The cause is the natively library security-provider (libnss3) only
#   supporting a small subset of the ECDH-backed ciphers while OpenJDK
#   believes all are supported.  If, during the TLS handshake, the
#   client and OpenJDK negotiated an ECDH cipher that libnss3 does not
#   support then the handshake will fail with a
#   CKR_DOMAIN_PARAMS_INVALID message.
#
#   Specifying DISABLE_EC will prevent dCache from selecting any
#   ECDH-backed cipher during the handshake.  In some cases, this
#   could result in a less secure cipher.
#
#   The problem is not due to OpenJDK code-base itself but rather from
#   how it is packaged by various distributions.  Different
#   distributions may have fixed this problem, but with different
#   versions.
#
#   You can check whether your installation of Java is affected by
#   starting dCache without DISABLE_EC and running a command like:
#
#       openssl s_client -connect srm.example.org:8445 -key ~/.globus/userkey.pem \
#           -cert ~/.globus/usercert.pem -cipher ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA
#
#   If the output includes:
#
#        SSL-Session:
#           Protocol  : TLSv1.2
#           Cipher    : ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA
#
#   then your distribution supports one of the problematic ciphers and
#   DISABLE_EC is not needed.
#
#   If, after the command, dCache logs "SSL handshake with [..]
#   failed: no cipher suites in common" then your distribution has
#   removed support for the problematic ciphers (possibly all ECDH
#   ciphers) and DISABLE_EC is not needed.
#
#   If, after the operation, the domain log includes a
#   "CKR_DOMAIN_PARAMS_INVALID" error then your Java requires the
#   DISABLE_EC.
#
#
#   DISABLE_RC4
#
#   RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) is a stream cipher that may be used to
#   secure a TLS or GSI connection.  RC4 has several potential
#   attacks, is widely considered weak and, for certain uses, broken.
#
#   Java 8u51 has made RC4 deprecated: it is only used if no non-RC4
#   is available.
#
#   By specifying DISABLE_RC4, dCache prevents RC4 from being used
#   under any circumstances, as required by RFC 7465.
#
(any-of?DISABLE_EC|DISABLE_RC4)dcache.authn.ciphers = DISABLE_EC,DISABLE_RC4

#  ---- Whether to overwrite existing files on upload
#
#   The following property affects FTP doors, WebDAV doors and the SRM.
#   For dcap see the dcap.authz.truncate property.  For xrootd, the policy is
#   controlled by the client. Note that setting the property to false
#   will break standards compliance.
#
(one-of?true|false)dcache.enable.overwrite = true

#  ---- Whether space reservation should be supported.
#
#   Whether to support space reservations in this dCache instance. This
#   controls whether services expect a spacemanager service to operate. Unless
#   you disable this feature, you must instantiate the spacemanager service by adding it
#   to the layout file on one of the dCache nodes (preferably in the same
#   domain as the poolmanager service).
#
(one-of?true|false)dcache.enable.space-reservation=true

#  ---- Upload directory
#
#   Some protocols (currently just SRM) allow a client to upload a file and, once
#   satisfied with the file's contents, make the new or updated file "live" in an
#   atomic operation. Such uploads may be aborted before the final step without
#   there being any noticeable effect for other users.
#
#   To achieve this, dCache will point clients to upload files beneath the
#   dcache.upload-directory directory, which must be owned by root and have
#   permission mask 711.  The directory is created automatically if it does not
#   exist and must be accessible through all doors used for SRM uploading.
#
#   If this property is set to an absolute path, it is interpreted as an absolute
#   path in dCache's name space. If this directory is not exposed by a door, that
#   door cannot be used for upload by SRM. This would happen if a non-default root
#   directory has been defined for a door, or if a non-default root directory
#   has been defined for users.
#
#   There are three ways to resolve this problem:
#
#   - Change dcache.upload-directory to a directory that is within a part of
#     the name space exposed by all doors needed for SRM and for all accounts
#     using SRM. E.g. if
#
#           /pnfs/example.org/data
#
#     is the root of all your doors and all your accounts, then setting
#
#           dcache.upload-directory = /pnfs/example.org/data/upload
#
#     is the best solution. This needs to be done for pnfsmanager and all
#     doors.
#
#     If accounts have individual root directories, then this solution may not
#     be suitable.
#
#   - Add additional FTP doors for the SRM configured with
#
#        ftp.root = /
#
#     or
#
#        ftp.root = ${ftp.authz.upload-directory}
#
#     This will expose the upload directory and SRM will automatically
#     prefer these for uploads. This could be done in the same domain as
#     existing doors using a non-standard TCP port.
#
#   - Defined a relative upload directory. If this property is defined to
#     a relative path, it is interpreted relative to the account's root
#     directory. It will thus appear in the name space exposed by the FTP
#     door. There are two downsides to this:
#
#       * The upload directory may conflict with user files and directories.
#
#       * There will be several upload directories scattered throughout the
#         name space. This may make it more difficult to clean up in case
#         dCache fails to remove temporary upload directories.
#

#          Database Configuration
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   The current setup assumes that one or more PostgreSQL servers are
#   used by the various dCache components.  Database user and database
#   password are configurable. The dCache components use several databases,
#   which might be located on separate hosts.
#
#   The most performant configuration is to have the database server
#   running on the same host as the dCache component that will
#   access it.  Therefore, the default value for all the following
#   variables is 'localhost'.  Uncomment and change these variables
#   only if you have a reason to deviate from this scheme.
#
#   For example, one valid deployment would be to put the 'billing'
#   database on different host than the pnfs server database and
#   companion, but keep the httpDomain on the admin host.

#  ---- Whether to manage database schemas automatically
#
#   When true, database schemas will be automatically updated when
#   needed. Not all services support this setting. This settings
#   applies to a complete domain and must not be defined at the
#   service level.
#

#  ---- Default host of RDBMS used by various services.
#
#   Various services need an RDBMS. Each service is recommended to use its
#   own logical database, but these may or may not be hosted in the same RDBMS
#   instance. This setting defines the host of the RDBMS used.
#
dcache.db.host = localhost

#  ---- Default RDBMS user account by various services.
#
dcache.db.user = dcache

#  ---- Default password of RDBMS used by various services.
#
dcache.db.password =

#  ---- Default password file for RDBMS used by various services.
#
#   Follows the format of the PostgreSQL pgpass file format. Avoids putting
#   the passwords in the dCache configuration files.
#

#       Tape protection
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   The    tape   protection    feature   is    only    available   if
#   dcache.authz.staging  is   defined,   and  there  is  a
#   similarly  named file  containing a  list of  FQANs and  DNs whose
#   owners are allowed to stage files (i.e., to read files from dCache
#   that are stored only on tape).
#
#   Stage configuration can  be provided either on the  door or on the
#   PoolManager as described in the following two cases below:
#
#      1) stage configuration provided on the door
#         (remember to repeat the same configuration on each door):
#         dcache.authz.staging.pep=doors
#      2) stage configuration provided on the PoolManager:
#         dcache.authz.staging.pep=PoolManager
#

#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#          Resilience (Replica Management)
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   Whether to support resilience (replication) in this dCache instance. This
#   controls whether functionality is added to the namespace, pool manager
#   and pools in order to maintain the proper number of copies for files written
#   to pools belonging to a resilient pool group and determined by constraints
#   defined for their storage unit.
#
#   The resilience mode controls how resilience is to run.
#
#      embedded:    runs resilience handling inside of the PnfsManager cell.
#
#      standalone:  runs resilience in a separate domain.  This option
#                   requires that a resilience cell be created in the layout.
#                   The cell optimally should be given its own domain, but
#                   in any case must not be run in the same domain as
#                   the PnfsManager.
#
#      off:         no resilience handling.
#
#   Resilience configuration on the pools and in the pool manager is keyed
#   to the dcache.enable.resilience property, whereas the pnfsmanager
#   embedded resilience is actived when the mode is 'embedded'.
